Data and code associated with "Assessing the Role of Patient Generation Techniques in Virtual Clinical Trial Outcomes" (Gevertz and Wares, 2024, Bulletin of Mathematical Biology 86: 119) is found in the Compare_Methods and Create_Simulated_Patients folders.
- To generate simulated patient data, run main_CA_vary_interactions_JG.m in Create_Simulated_Patients folder. This step is not required to run the virtual clinical trials, as the simulated data we used is already saved in CA_tumors.mat in the Compare_Methods folder. 
- To generate data displayed in Figures 4-6, run VCT_figures456Final.m in Compare_Methods folder.
- The data in Figure 7 comes from changing parameter values in VCT_figures456Final.m and collecting the statistics across runs.

Data and code associated with "A practical guide for the generation of model-based virtual clinical trials" (Craig, Gevertz, Kareva, Wilkie, 2025, Frontiers in Systems Biology 3: 1174647) is found in the OV_VPops folder.
- Running any code in this folder requires saving the data_Ad.mat file in the same directory as the codes
- The virtual patients are generated by running OV_VPops.m. The output that is presented in Figure 3 of the cited paper is found in the uploaded VPops.mat file.
- OV_VCT.m reads in the data and the virtual patients to conduct the virtual clinical trial.
