# VCT
Data and code associated with "Assessing the Role of Patient Generation Techniques in Virtual Clinical Trial Outcomes"
- To generate simulated patient data, run main_CA_vary_interactions_JG.m in Create_Simulated_Patients folder. This step is not required to run the virtual clinical trials, as the simulated data we used is already saved in CA_tumors.mat in the Compare_Methods folder. 
- To generate data displayed in Figures 4-6, run VCT_figures456Final.m in Compare_Methods folder.
- The data in Figure 7 comes from changing parameter values in VCT_figures456Final.m and collecting the statistics across runs.
